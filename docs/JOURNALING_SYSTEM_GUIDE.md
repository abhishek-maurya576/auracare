## üîê **Security & Encryption**

### **End-to-End Encryption Implementation**

#### **User-Specific Encryption Keys**
```typescript
// Journal Encryption Process
class JournalEncryption {
  // Generate unique encryption key per user
  static async generateUserKey(userId: string): Promise<string> {
    const keyMaterial = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
      { name: 'AES-GCM', length: 256 },
      true,
      ['encrypt', 'decrypt']
    );
    return await crypto.subtle.exportKey('raw', keyMaterial);
  }

  // Encrypt journal entry
  static async encryptEntry(content: string, userKey: string): Promise<EncryptedEntry> {
    const iv = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12));
    const encodedContent = new TextEncoder().encode(content);
    
    const encryptedContent = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
      { name: 'AES-GCM', iv: iv },
      userKey,
      encodedContent
    );

    return {
      encryptedData: Array.from(new Uint8Array(encryptedContent)),
      iv: Array.from(iv),
      timestamp: Date.now()
    };
  }
}
```

#### **Encryption Layers**
```
Layer 1: Content Encryption (AES-256-GCM)
- Journal entry content
- Personal reflections
- Sensitive thoughts and feelings

Layer 2: Metadata Encryption (AES-128-GCM)
- Entry titles
- Tags and categories
- Timestamps and statistics

Layer 3: Transport Encryption (TLS 1.3)
- Data transmission to/from servers
- API communications
- Backup synchronization
```

### **Key Management**

#### **Local Key Storage**
- **Secure Storage**: Keys stored in device secure storage
- **Biometric Protection**: Keys protected by biometric authentication
- **No Cloud Storage**: Encryption keys never leave the device
- **Automatic Rotation**: Keys rotated every 90 days for security

#### **Key Recovery Options**
```
Recovery Methods:
1. Biometric Authentication: Primary recovery method
2. Master Password: Backup recovery option
3. Security Questions: Additional verification
4. Recovery Phrase: Offline recovery option (optional)

Recovery Limitations:
- No server-side key recovery
- Lost keys = lost data (by design)
- Clear user education about key importance
