## 🎯 How Personalization Works

### Data Flow
1. **User Signs In** → Profile automatically loaded/created
2. **User Completes Setup** → Preferences saved to Firestore and Gemini service
3. **User Logs Mood** → Patterns automatically updated in profile
4. **User Chats with AI** → Personalized context sent with each message
5. **AI Responds** → Tailored response based on user profile and history

### Personalization Context Includes:
- User's name and basic info
- Mental health goals
- Preferred coping strategies
- Communication style preference
- Known triggers (handled sensitively)
- Personal strengths
- Recent mood patterns
- Stress level trends
- Crisis indicators

### AI Response Enhancement:
- **Before**: Generic, one-size-fits-all responses
- **After**: Personalized responses that reference user's name, goals, preferred strategies, and acknowledge their journey

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Storage

    ├── moodPatterns: {averages, trends, triggers}
    ├── aiSettings: {personalization enabled, conversation depth}
    └── privacy: {data sharing preferences}
```
