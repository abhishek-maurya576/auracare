**With Personalization Response:**
"Hi [Your Name], I can see work anxiety is something you've been dealing with lately. Since you mentioned that meditation and deep breathing work well for you, would you like to try a quick 5-minute session? I also want to remind you of your resilience - you've handled work stress before and came through it stronger."

#### Test Message 2: "I don't know how to handle this stress"
**Without Personalization Response:**
"Stress can be overwhelming. Here are some general coping strategies you might try..."

**With Personalization Response:**
"I remember you mentioned that journaling and meditation are strategies that work for you. Given your recent stress patterns, especially around work situations, would you like to try writing down your thoughts first? Your empathetic nature is actually a strength here - you understand your own needs well."

#### Test Message 3: "I'm having a good day today"
**Without Personalization Response:**
"That's wonderful to hear! What made today special?"

**With Personalization Response:**
"That's fantastic, [Your Name]! I'm so glad to hear this, especially after the work stress you mentioned recently. Your resilience is really showing through. What helped make today better? Was it one of your preferred strategies like meditation?"
